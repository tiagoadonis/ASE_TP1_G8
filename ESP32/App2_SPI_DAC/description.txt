This is an application that uses the SPI on the 25LC040A SPI EEPROM. It writes some data on the EEPROM and with DAC change the voltage (show with a led),
reads this data and then prints it on the screen.

Peripherals configuration:

- 25LC040A SPI EEPROM
  - CS: GPIO18
  - MISO: GPIO19
  - MOSI: GPIO25
  - SCLK: GPIO27
  
 - DAC
  - DAC_CHANNEL_2: GPIO26
