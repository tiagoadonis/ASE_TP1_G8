This is an applications that makes the led blink in an higher frequency when the distance calculated by the ultrasonic is smaller.
The distance is calculated by the following formula:

distance = (timeElapsed *34300) / 2

34300 -> the sonnic speed (34300 cm/s)
divide by 2, the going and coming path of the pulse
