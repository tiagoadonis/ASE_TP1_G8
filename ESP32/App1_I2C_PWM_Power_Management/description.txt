This is a application that uses I2C based on the TC74 I2C temperature sensor and the PWM on two LEDs.
The temperature sensor reads the temperature on the local and if the temperature is higher than 30ºC 
the red LED blinks. If the temperature maintains under the 30ºC the green LED blinks.
This application uses the light sleep feature from the power management capabilities. 
The board is in light sleep and when the BOOT_BUTTON is pressed, it wakes up and shows the actual temperature.

Peripherals configuration:

- TC74 I2C temperature sensor
  - SDA: GPIO_21
  - SCLK: GPIO_22

- LEDs (PWM)
  - Red LED: GPIO4
  - Green LED: GPIO5
